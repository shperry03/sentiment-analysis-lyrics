# Song Positivity Project

## Overview
This project allows a user to input a song and artist and generate a more positive version of the song. It uses the Genius API to search for song lyrics automatically, LLMs for sentiment analysis as well as generation, and is written using python - pytorch, transformers library. I wanted to do a fun project to teach myself how to work with LLMs for different projects and learn to fine-tune models. 

The project uses OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo model for lyric generation. In test, that worked the best for me and I thought it generated some fun responses that still fit within the themes of the songs.

I still have to implement a front-end and might make AI covers of the actual songs with the "more positve" versions if I continue working with the project. 

## How to use 
Just input a song and the artist and then watch the new lyrics generated. 

## Purpose
This project is meant to be fun and produce horrible lyrics. I wanted to learn how to develop with LLMs and fine tune a model to fit your project. The lyrics it produces are horrible but funny and uses LLMs, so my project purpose was fulfilled.
